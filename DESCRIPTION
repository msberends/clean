Description: A wrapper around the new 'cleaner' package, that allows
  data cleaning functions for classes 'logical', 'factor', 'numeric', 
  'character', 'currency' and 'Date' to make data cleaning fast and
  easy. Relying on very few dependencies, it provides smart guessing,
  but with user options to override anything if needed.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), cleaner (>= 1.2.0)
